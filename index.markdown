Hello! Welcome to hoenggung888.github.io, the first website created using the Jekyll web framework hosted on Github Pages. Check out the source links down below under the Github profile.

Website creation has gone a long way from simply typing code into an .html file. Various interactive online website makers like Squarespace and GoDaddy makes it easy to design and implement a website. Anyone can make a website with ease and convenience, with it being drag and drop and presto. Afterall, we are a modern society and website makers make lives of businesses easier, and for cheap too: Wix is a free website hosting and creation service, and those who want more features can go for a premium service such as the aforementioned Squarespace and GoDaddy.

But what's the fun in that?

Behind each website maker there is a website (obviously) and a program to be coded. It cannot be implemented out of thin air, so where does it start? Well, it is like the chicken and egg question, except more obvious. The primative way of website is by coding. This website was not made by Wix or GoDaddy; it is made from code, by hoenggung888, for the purpose of teaching how website coding works, and the things that make coding even easier than it was decades ago. From the very basics of an .html file to a whole truckload of .html, .css, .js (JavaScript) and more file types, it is surely more interesting to see letters and numbers translate to art, that is, the website at hand.

Now I know, letters and numbers can be confusing to look at and think "What is the magic behind all this???". However, there is nothing complicated that only the geniuses of Apple and Google will know about website coding. It is no doubt that there is a learning curve makign a website this way that some may not have time to commit to. However, with the world ever so dependent on technology, the world of coding will keep on growing. This website is for those who are interested in learning how this website is created and implemented using code. From there, those who want to venture further into the realm of code can move to software design or even understand the underpinnings of operating systems like Windows and Mac OS (although the latter is not recommended in my opinion).

With that, check out the rest of the website!
